v0.0.5 Jun 25, 2019
====================

* update web layers to always contribute,
  - this is a <10MB contribution so should not have much performance impact
  - always write start command (so we can re-build the same image)
  - add tests for pushing twice

v0.0.4 May 28, 2019
====================

* If we're using PHP, mark the layer as build=true. This is necessary so that env variables from the PHP layer are present in other layers at build time.

* Support libcfbuildpack packager
  - Rename procmgr.go to main.go to support consistent build.sh script
  - Add included_files and build.sh as pre-package script
  - Remove buildpacks from id for consistency

v0.0.3 Apr 30, 2019
====================
* Update dependencies, and build tools.

v0.0.2 Mar 25, 2019
====================

* Bump libcfbuildpack and dagger
  (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/164601296)
  (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/163595064)

* Add support for specifying a library directory through buildpack.yml. This gets put onto PHP's include_path.

* When no buildpack.yml exists, write out sha1 of metadata, and only rebuild app if user adds buildpack.yml.
